The NMEHS at Chembur was started in the year 
1970 with only 12 tiny tots from the nearby 
areas in a garage near Chembur Railway Station.

The founder of this blessed education 
institution is Prof. D. K. Kunder. It was due to 
his dedication, determination, discipline and 
devotion that the strength of students steadily 
increased to around 100 within a span of 2 
years. This feat was also possible due to the 
profound backing of Janta Shikshan Kendra and 
the staff.

A full fledged school was started in the year 
1973 with recognition of Maharashtra 
Government (unaided basis) in the Shrama
Safalya building near Chembur Railway Station 
and later on extended its wings of glory to 
Popular House, Lokhande Marg, Chembur.

The Maxim "Hard work brings success" proved 
true NMEHS grew by leaps and bounds with 
the co-operation of parents, well qualified, 
dedicated and experienced teachers. The yearly 
addition of laurels, trophies and awards won by 
teachers and student to the school's records is a 
clear indication of NMEHS's onward march toÂ glory.
